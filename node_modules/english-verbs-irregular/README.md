The value is an array:
- generally with one single value: `"write": [ [ "wrote", "written" ] ]`
- sometimes with multiple ones: `"weave": [ ["wove", "woven"], ["weaved", "weaved"] ]` or `"be": [ ["was", "been"], ["were", "been"] ]` - it's up to you to decide which one is the proper one!

The gerunds/progressive form (...ing) are not in the list.
