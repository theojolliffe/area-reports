  - @return {object} new data with more attributes

2. **getDifference(data)**
  - Get the difference between old value and current value
  - @param  {object}        data object (see the constructor properties)
  - @return {number/string} difference value or 'na' if there is no oldData

3. **getDisplayInfo(data)**
  - Prepare strings required to show in the sentence
  - @param  {object} data object (see the constructor properties)
  - @return {object} information required to display in the sentence (default is ```title```, ```newData```, ```oldData```, and ```difference```)

4. **calculatePriority(data)**
  - Calculate the priority of change
  - @param  {object} data object (see the constructor properties)
  - @return {number} new priority

5. **calculateLevel(data)**
  - Calculate the intesity of change
  - @param  {object} data object (see the constructor properties)
  - @return {number} intensity of the change (from -3 to 3)

#### Add dataType
Data type can be added using addType() method
```
NL.addSentence: (title, func = {})
```
- **title**: name of the type
- **func**: function(s) to override

##### Functions available for overriding

1. **getSimpleSentenceList(data, simpleSentencese)**
  - Get a valid list of sentences for random selecting
  - @param  {object} data - data object
  - @param  {array}  simpleSentences - sentences from all types
  - @return {array}  array of valid sentences

2. **getCompoundSentenceList(data, compoundSentences)**
  - Get a valid list of compound sentences
  - @param  {object} data - data object
  - @param  {array}  compoundSentences - sentences from all types
